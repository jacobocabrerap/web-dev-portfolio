        <li>Divide the dough into four equal-sized portions, and form into small balls. Then take the first ball in your hands, and sink it in the center, as if you wanted to make a bowl of dough. Place a small piece of cheese in the center.</li>
        <li>Then, join the edges at the top, sealing the arepa.</li>
        <li>Delicately using your fingertips, perfect any detail and make sure the arepa is even.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the pan where the arepas will be made and spread the butter over the entire surface. Then, place the arepas to cook, about five minutes on each side. Remove from pan and consume immediately. If you wish you can place an extra slice of cheese on top.</li>
